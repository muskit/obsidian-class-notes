### Disadvantages of Naive Bayes
- performance may take a hit when considering too many variables
- does not account for dependent variables

# Bayesian Network
*a graph-based framework for representing and analyzing models involving uncertainty*

**graphs**...
- nodes = variables
- edges = probabilistic dependence between variables

## Example: Icy roads
A road can be **icy** or not. In either driving situations, there's always a chance of an **accident**.

If A crashed, even though we don't know if the road is icy, **knowing that A has crashed increases the chances of B having an accident**; there's an implication now that current conditions *may* increase the chances of accidents
- Evidence (A has crashed) increased the probability of road being icy
- If we learn later that **the roads weren't icy**, then B's chances of having an accident is DECREASED upon learning that information
