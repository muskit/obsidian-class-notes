### Disadvantages of Naive Bayes
- performance may take a hit when considering too many variables
- does not account for dependent variables

# Bayesian Network
*a graph-based framework for representing and analyzing models involving uncertainty*

**graphs**...
- nodes = variables
- edges = probabilistic dependence between variables
