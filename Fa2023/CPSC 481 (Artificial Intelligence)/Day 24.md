# Decision Tree
*allows for decision-making based on the dataset's subsets **(classification)***
- constructed during **model training**

Consists of...
- root node
	- divides the whole dataset into 2+ sets
- decision node
	- splits input dataset based on criteria (decides)
- leaf (terminal) node
	- class; result of classification

<u>Decision Tree Process</u>
1. **Model Training:** tree construction using training dataset
2. **New Data Point**: user *inputs* certain observation(s)
3. **Prediction**: use features of data point(s) (user input) to navigate tree and reach a leaf
4. **Output**: prediction for given data point

Example: patient's risk for a disease given the patient's certain features and criteria based on those features
