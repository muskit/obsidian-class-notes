# Virtual Machine Setup

## Network
We'll want to create a closed off network between our victim Windows VM and our analyzer Remnux VM.
- Make sure malware doesn't try to attack/contact the internet
- We'll need to make the network *appear* connected to the internet in case the malware has checks
	- We can divert traffic to something we control (ie. Remnux VM?)

Windows VM
- victim
- runs malware

Remnux VM
- netcat
- INetSim
- Wireshark
- IP/Domain Lookup deviation

## DLL Handling Types
**Static Imports**
Import libraries via **metadata**
**Dynamic Imports**
Libraries loaded **programically**
``` C++
auto l = LoadLibrary("foo.dll");
auto f = GetProcAddress(library, "printf")
// f points to function "printf" from "foo.dll"
```
