# Search algorithms
uninformed search
- exploring the problem space without any knowledge about the goal (getting closer? what area to search?)
- effective with smaller, simpler problem spaces
- ex: depth-first tree search
	a. root node A is first in the frontier stack
	b. push A's children B & C into the frontier stack
	c. pop C, explore its children
