My class notes. Best viewed in [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). Newlines, in particular, do not work the same on GitHub; this results in separate lines being together when viewed on GitHub!

**WARNING**: It's possible that the Obsidian Git plugin is broken for this vault, especially on mobile devices. This should only concern me as the note-taker/author.
