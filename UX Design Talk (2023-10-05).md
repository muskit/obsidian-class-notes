Graphic Designer graduate, eventually self-taught webdev
- as industry shifted, fell into UX design and frontend dev

first company: Neogov
> Good design isn't always flashy... (it's a balance)

Ticketmaster
- keeping in mind in design: "what's best for the user?"
- good design: **when it's not noticed**

Google - the big break?
- reached out to by co. after COVID layoffs
- applied ~10 times prior
- worked on business analytics
- w/ large companies, **more** time is spent negotiating and meeting to push projects (80% talk, 20% work)

Riot Games - a more enjoyable work
- works on designing game UI
